# End-to-End Machine Learning Project

Welcome to our comprehensive End-to-End Machine Learning Project! This project is designed to guide you through the entire process of developing a machine learning model, from data collection to deployment. 

## Key Features
- **Data Collection**: Gather and preprocess data from various sources.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Visualize and understand data patterns.
- **Model Building**: Implement and train machine learning models.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assess model performance using various metrics.
- **Deployment**: Deploy the model to a production environment.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation.
- **Scikit-Learn**: Machine learning algorithms.
- **TensorFlow**: Deep learning framework.
- **Flask**: Web framework for deployment.
